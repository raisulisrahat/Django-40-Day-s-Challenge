### **Day 3: Create Your First Django Project**
1. **Create a Django Project:**
   ```
   # Create a new Django project named 'myproject'
   django-admin startproject myproject
   ```

2. **Navigate into the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd myproject
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   This command will start the development server. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or `http://localhost:8000/` to see the default Django welcome page.

You've now set up a virtual environment, installed Django, and created your first Django project. This establishes the foundation for the upcoming days of exploration and learning within the Django framework.
